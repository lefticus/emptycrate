I thought I would take a moment to mention that [Pinheads: Everything You Need](http://game.emptycrate.com/node/30) is now an award winning game. Pinheads was the first game created with the [EmptyCrate Game Engine](http://emptycrategameengine.googlecode.com). [img_assist|nid=326|title=Pinheads Screenshot|desc=|link=url|url=http://game.emptycrate.com/node/30|align=center|width=320|height=240] Pinheads was created for the [Christian Developers Network Speedgame 2008 Competition](http://speedgame.christiandevs.com/) in August 2008. The winners were announced at the end of August, but I have not seen any websites acknowledge the end of the competition. For its part, Pinheads won 2nd prize in the "Creativity" category.
