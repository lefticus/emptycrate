Well, I needed to spend some time working on the Biblestudy application. It's been a real pain, several problems with wxMozilla, Mozilla, wxWindows, Sword and ReadingPlanner, but I got it all worked out. I have a windows build that works except for some annoying debugging messages from Mozilla. 

Tomorrow or the next day I will chronicle everything that it took to get the project compiled under windows using Cygwin/Mingw, for anyone else that needs that information. I will also be making a release candidate soon, probably by Tuesday.
