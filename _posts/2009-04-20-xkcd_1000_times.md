I was reminded of a [recent](http://xkcd.org/558/) xkcd comic while installing Inform 7 today: [img_assist|nid=401|title=Inform 7 Installer|desc=|link=popup|align=none|width=640|height=500] (yellow highlight [poorly] added by me). This is not a knock against Inform's installer, I've noticed it several times lately. 

Each time I go "whoah, that'll use 1/2 of my harddrive... wait a second." It really would be better if installers could provide some sort of scale to make it more obvious that you are using .05% of your available space, *not* 53%.
