I have been working for the past few weeks on [ChaiDraw](https://github.com/lefticus/chaidraw). ChaiDraw is an application that's both meant as an educational toy and as a showcase for how to effectively use [ChaiScript](http://www.chaiscript.com) in your application. 

It turns out it's actually a fun little toy to play with. Check it out if you have an interest in programming toys or especially if you have an interest in ChaiScript. Since ChaiDraw is a showcase for ChaiScript, I should point out that the ChaiScript specific code in the application only accounts for 32 lines of C++. There aren't many (any?) scripting languages that can accomplish that.
