[img_assist|nid=442|title=ChaiDraw Screenshot|desc=|link=popup|align=right|width=130|height=72]I have been working for the past few weeks on [ChaiDraw](http://chaidraw.googlecode.com). ChaiDraw is an application that's both meant as an educational toy and as a showcase for how to effectively use [ChaiScript](http://www.chaiscript.com) in your application. It turns out it's actually a fun little toy to play with. Check it out if you have an interest in programming toys or especially if you have an interest in ChaiScript. Since ChaiDraw is a showcase for ChaiScript, I should point out that the ChaiScript specific code in the application only accounts for 32 lines of C++. There aren't many (any?) scripting languages that can accomplish that.
