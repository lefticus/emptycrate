Milestone 3.5 of the Crate Game Engine has been posted on [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/emptycrate/) and [freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/projects/emtpycrate/). This release, in many ways, wraps up the functionality for the Console Rendering Engine. Very many features for interaction with in game characters and items have been added. Looking forward, the next step is to add support for scripting. Once that is working, I will begin work on the graphical rendering engine. I will be posting blog entries about the progress for adding scripting.
