*Disclaimer: I have not read the book and currently do not plan to see the movie* [Focus on the Family](http://family.org) has part 1 of 2 of a series on [The Da Vinci Code](http://www.family.org/fmedia/broadcast/a0039965.cfm) on their website right now. This is one of those times where how you feel about Focus on the Family doesn't matter. 

The broadcast is a look at what The Da Vinci Code claims as fact or truth and how it relates to what actually has happened in history and the Bible itself. If the book has made you question what the truth is about Christianity and its claims I strongly suggest you listen to the broadcast.
