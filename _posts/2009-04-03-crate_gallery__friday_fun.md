Here's some Friday fun to waste your day with, and a bit of a poke at this website's namesake: the empty crate. It seems that crates are used in so many video games that there is a rather [disturbingly large collection](http://www.arminbwagner.com/crates_and_barrels/crates.html) of screenshots of crates in games. 

If you love the classics and history of video games like I do (yes, I did read the entire "[The Ultimate History of Video Games](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761536434?ie=UTF8&tag=empcra-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0761536434)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=empcra-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0761536434)"), you can waste the better part of today looking through them.
