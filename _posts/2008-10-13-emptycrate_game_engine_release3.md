The next release of the EmptyCrate Game Engine has been [released](http://emptycrategameengine.googlecode.com). Changes:

-   Fixed minor game-item scripting problems.
-   Added subtitle feature.

This release also notes the release of the 7th game written using the engine. All games that I'm aware of are available at [game.emptycrate.com](http://game.emptycrate.com).
