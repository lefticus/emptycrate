[img_assist|nid=365|title=Duty and Beyond Screenshot|desc=|link=popup|align=right|width=320|height=200]Well, it's official. My first game review for [Adventure Gamers](http://www.adventuregamers.com) was [published](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18248) today. It was a learning experience getting it out there, being the first time I have had to work with an editor. The review is for an amateur adventure called "[Duty and Beyond](http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?action=detail&id=747)" the game is worth playing if you have any interest in adventure games. Amateur adventures, by the way, will be my specialty at Adventure Gamers. I hope to get out at least a few reviews a year.
