> A federal judge has declared unconstitutional a 2001 law passed by the Utah Legislature that banned payroll deductions for political organizations for employees of school districts and other government entities. In her ruling published Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell found that the law served no "compelling state interest" in limiting the ability of school districts and other governmental entities to offer voluntary payroll deductions for their employees for organizations like the Utah Education Association. The judge also said the law violated government employees' freedom of speech.

This one might actually be a good ruling...
