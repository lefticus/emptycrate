I'm hoping to finalize the details of a paid contract to enhance the [Swig Starter Kit](/tags/swig-starter-kit) soon. If the contract goes through, you can expect to see some significant enhancements. Specifically, Visual Studio, smart pointer and exceptions support will be added. Also, you can expect to see significant improvements in documentation. This particular client found me through the, "If you like this software, please consider hiring me," license that I show on the [google code project page](http://code.google.com/p/swigstarterkit/). If anyone else is interested, I am [available](/contact) for C++ project work.
