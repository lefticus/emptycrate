We are proud to announce two new [ChaiScript](http://www.chaiscript.com) releases: ChaiScript 4.0.0

-   Lots of bug fixes
-   Performance improvements
-   Support for `?:` ternary operators
-   Support for switch statements

ChaiScript 5.0.0 This release is a complete retooling of ChaiScript that uses C++11 instead of Boost.

-   Better performance
-   Truly 0 external dependencies
-   ChaiScript stdlib can optionally be compiled separately as a loadable module
-   Better error reporting from scripts

We will continue to provide support for ChaiScript 4 until compiler support catches up.
