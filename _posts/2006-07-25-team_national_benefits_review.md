NOTE: This discussion has gotten out of hand, so I have disabled comments. This article was meant as a review from a consumer perspective. Yes, there are ways to make money off of this program, but that is not the focus of this article. I am no longer maintiaining this article and will not be updating it as things at Team National (TM) changes. **What is Team National and Why Do You / Should We Care?** We have many friends from church who have bought into the [Team National (TM)](http://bign.com) (aka National Companies, Inc (TM), aka Big N (TM)) [MLM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing) system. We were invited to one of their meetings where they try to get new members to buy the benefits package. While there, we heard many heart felt stories about money saved and lives changed; people quiting their jobs because they are making so much money with the company; etc. We did not buy into the system that night, but thought we should take it seriously, mainly because of all the friends that were involved. As we began to look closer we saw that things are not what they seem. Some of the more interesting ways to save money are available to anyone (see the [Marketplace](#marketplace) below). Some of them are not benefits at all, particularly the [insurance rates](#autoinsurance), which were mentioned quite frequently in the meeting we attended. **About Team National (TM)** Membership to Team National (TM) costs $795 for 2 years or $2195 for a lifetime. The lifetime membership also provides "benefits" to your parents, children, and grandchildren, for their lifetimes. Because of this, many people will think they are getting such a great deal that it cannot be passed up. However, $2200 is still a lot of money today and should be considered very carefully. Probably the first question that should be asked is, "What benefits do they offer?" If you go to a meeting for Team National (TM) you will likely hear lots of talk about how Team National (TM) members are:

1.  Saving Lots of Money
2.  Making Lots of Money

**Saving Lots of Money** Team National claims to provide their members with great discounts on big ticket items because of their group buying power. From my research most of these benefits seem to be little more than marketing gimmicks whereby Team National (TM) is marketing to their own members, with little or no benefit to the member. Specifically, the following benefits are affiliate links to outside companies. I have no internal knowledge of Team National (TM)'s finances, so I cannot speak to their specific arrangements, but in a normal affiliate relationship, the affiliate gets some kind of commission from the outside company for every clicked link or sale made. To clarify, as far as I can tell, when a TN member buys from one of the links below, Team National (TM) receives a commission. "Affiliate Benefits":

-   Commercial Loans
-   Credit Card Merchant Accounts
-   Equipment Leasing
-   [VoIP Phone Service](http://www.teamtalk.us/)
-   Wireless Phone Service
-   Internet Turbo Accelerator
-   Steel Framed Homes
-   Home Insurance
-   Auto Insurance
-   Life Insurance
-   ID Theft
-   [Travel Benefit](http://nc.tripforce.com/travel/arc.cfm?tab=a)

There are other benefits which are in no way related to Team National (TM) and are just websites that anyone can use:

-   [Log Homes](http://www.amlhs.com/index_permit.html)
-   [Domain Name Registration](http://www.discountdomainsplus.com/)
-   [Prescriptions](http://www.prescriptionsforus.com/)
-   [Choppers](http://www.tntchoppers.net/)
-   Roadside assistance

Then there are the questionable benefits, where it is difficult to judge whether or not a Team National (TM) Member is getting a good deal:

-   American Program Vehicle Discounts
-   Import Program Vehicle Discounts
-   Real Estate
-   Jewelry
-   Factory Direct Store

The following are the actual quantifiable benefits that I could see:

-   Eyeware discount program
-   Miracle Ear Discount Program
-   Discount Horse Trailers
-   Discount [Leather Goods](http://www.pbleathers.com/scripts/teamnational.php)
-   Discount on Goodyear Tires
-   New Vehicle Discounts
-   Mortgages

The store BigN is little more than a place to buy supplies to market the program to other people. There are some actual products like vitamins and engine cleaner, but they are all Team National (TM) brand. **Making Lots of Money** \*\* I've removed the Making Lots of Money as an IMD section as it does not fit with the goal of providing a review of the benefits. Suffice to say, yes it is possible to make lost of money with Team Nation (TM) however, I would suggest you be the first person in a group of friends/neighborhood/city if this is your main reason for becomming an IMD. \*\* **The Marketplace** The second way to make money with Team National (TM) is through their [Big N Marketplace](http://www.bign.com/marketplace/default.asp). To me, this is one of the most intriguing and deceptive sides of this business. (If they described it for what it was, I would be all for it, but they don't.) This is the gist of it: Team National (TM) sells webspace for $8/page/month. That's relatively expensive. However, they populate these pages for you with a "Marketplace." The Marketplace, as it were, is a list of advertisements, which use [Commission Junction](http://cj.com) and [LinkShare](http://www.linkshare.com). The intriguing part is that Team National then gives you all (or so they say) of the money that is earned from commissions and clicks on your Marketplace. This gives the individual user the ability to make money off of his own purchases. There are two gotchas to this:

1.  Anyone can set up a site with these ad links and accomplish the same thing for LESS
2.  It's NOT a Team National (TM) Benefit!

**General Concerns** "Success From Home Magazine" seems to be pretty much just an ad for MLM's. "USA Today Article in 2005": You may also hear about the article in 2005 in USA Today that was full of praise for Team National (TM). In actuality, the "article" was a multipage ad spread paid for by the [DSA](http://www.dsa.org). The "article" is available [here](http://www.dsa.org/press/press_releases/index.cfm?fuseaction=show_release&Document_id=577). Nature of a Binary Tree: Team National (TM) does not allow any one IMD to have more than 2 people he has sold directly to. This forces a binary tree structure on the organization. You must have at least 2 rows of people below you to make money, due to the nature of a binary tree, this means a full **75%** of the people that ever join Team National are guaranteed to never make ANY money. An additional 12.5% will never make more than $1500. Fully **87.5%** of the people that join will not recoop their investment through commissions. **Final Thoughts** There is one other benefit not really mentioned here. There is a company directory where benefits owners can advertise their own businesses for free... to other Team National (TM) members. It is possible this benefit alone could be worth it to a business owner, but it is of 0 value to the average individual. One final thing that should raise a red flag about this company. Their privacy policy states that they are very concerned about your privacy and security. However, I did not see a single web page that had SSL encryption enabled. This means that your Team National (TM) ID and password is being sent around in a way that anyone with the know how could read it. On a more positive note, I know that many people do not know how to make effective use of the internet. Because of this, I will acknowledge that having access to Team National's website may help some people make better use of the internet than they might have otherwise. If the membership were marketed this way, I would be much less critical. It's also worth mentioning the fact that the salesmen at a given meeting are just other people who have bought into the company, so I do not believe they are necessarily trying to be deceitful; but that perhaps they don't realize any of the above issues.
