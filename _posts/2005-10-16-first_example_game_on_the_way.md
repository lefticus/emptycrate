A lot of work has gone into the ConsoleRenderingEngine this weekend, which will allow a game to be played from the command line. The first game to take advantage of this rendering engine is in the works and under the directory examples/hardcoded. Things are going pretty smoothly right now, this proof of concept rendering engine and game are helping me to sort out a lot of the little details for how a game will work. Also, a minor little detail, I forgot to tag the release of Milestone 1 in CVS last week. So that release is mostly lost. I will be sure to tag any future release. I expect Milestone 2 very soon, hopefully this week. Next on the map is to be able to load a game object model from an XML file.
