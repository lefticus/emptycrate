Getting the chance to refresh myself in UML and OOD this week while working with Umbrello. I think I have a pretty good model started. I'm getting close to a design that I can start fleshing out. Main components still missing include a class representing the player and some kind of turn system. 

Oh, I also need to add support for "use" and "use with" for items. I'm not yet convinced that I have abstracted the gameplay from the graphics enough, I'll probably take another look at that tonight. Expect that I will start posting umbrello diagrams soon.
