My second adventure game review was [published](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18287) at [Adventure Gamers](http://www.adventuregamers.com). 

The game is excellent, and worth playing. Also, it's worth pointing out that the developer of Nanobots is currently working on a commercial game, [Puzzle Bots](http://www.adventuregamers.com/games/view/16765). I hope to review that one as well. From my perspective, the editing went quite a bit more smoothly than it did with the [Duty and Beyond review](/content/duty-and-beyond-review-posted). Now to find the next [Freeware Adventure](http://www.adventuregamers.com/freeware.php) to review.
