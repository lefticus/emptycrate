My [Acer Aspire One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYV9TM?ie=UTF8&tag=empcra-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001EYV9TM)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=empcra-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001EYV9TM) is quickly becoming the only "book" that I carry. To be a complete replacement for books that I like to have around, it was necessary to find some Bible software for it, so here's a quick wrap up of what I found. I had a few requirements:

1.  Cheap or free
2.  At least the commercial [NET](http://www.bible.org/) notes module available
3.  Paragraph formatting available

**e-Sword** 

The first software I tried was the free [e-Sword](http://e-sword.net/). e-Sword does have copyrighted Bible modules available for it. But it fails to provide a paragraph layout. Also, e-Sword requires a separate download and install for each module you want to add to it, this becomes quite tiring and annoying if you want to add several books at a time. Another mild annoyance is that I cannot find any way to disable all of the markup in the text. As you can see from the screenshot the text is rather busy.

**Xiphos** 

The next software tried was [Xiphos](http://xiphos.org/). Xiphos is an open source front-end to the [SWORD](http://crosswire.org/sword) library. It's free, has the NET available for it (all SWORD front-ends have it available) and has a lot of options for formatting the Bible text. Also, Xiphos has a great module manager built in to it, with downloading capabilities for all of the freely available SWORD modules. The UI is simple and clean. However the NET is the only copyrighted text available for it. An unspoken desire that was added after I started looking was to have the [HCSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holman_Christian_Standard_Bible) available.

**WORDSearch 8** 

The software I ultimately ended up using is [WORDSearch 8](http://www.wordsearchbible.com/catalog/product.php?pid=2439). I tried the free little brother of WORDSearch, [Bible Explorer](http://www.wordsearchbible.com/be4.php), first, but it really does not do the commercial version justice. The company would do well to provide more screenshots and info on the commercial version. WORDSearch has just about every Bible translation available for it, commercial or otherwise. My main complaint is the modules that it does not offer for free, but are freely available in other software. For example, the complete Matthew Henry's Commentary is $59, but it is available for free with Xiphos. The free version of the NET is also not available; if you want the text you'll have to buy the $20 complete version of the NET. Even though I'm very satisfied with WORDSearch I'll be keeping Xiphos around for those reasons.
