GCC 4.4.0 was [released](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/) on April 21st. Notable [changes](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/changes.html) include fascinating new optimizations for loops. Particularly, they include the ability for the compiler to automatically rewrite loops to take into account memory layout of the system. I recall distinctly in my Intro to Data Structures CS class the teacher using the example of a two dimensional loop which iterated the "wrong way" (causing many disparate memory look ups and cache-misses) as a classic performance killer. Example (from GCC's website), GCC is now able to perform the following optimization:

> -floop-interchange performs loop interchange transformations on loops. Interchanging two nested loops switches the inner and outer loops. For example, given a loop like: ` DO J = 1, M   DO I = 1, N      A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C   ENDDO ENDDO`
> loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user had written: ` DO I = 1, N   DO J = 1, M     A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C   ENDDO ENDDO`

Also, GCC 4.4.0 includes many enhancements to its [implementation](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/cxx0x_status.html) of the C++0x draft standard.
