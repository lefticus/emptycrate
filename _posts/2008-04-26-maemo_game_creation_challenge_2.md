Well, I've now had 4 hours of time to work. My Saturday is getting broken up more than I anticipated and it looks like I'll only get about 5 hours total today. We'll see. 

Currently the code checked in to the google code [project](http://exastris.googlecode.com) generates a random universe of 3-8 galaxies with 750-150 planets in each galaxy. I'm really not very happy with the distribution of planets in the galaxy and have spent probably 1 out of the 4 hours just trying to make that better. I've decided to give up on that and move on to the game player and game dynamics. 

I don't have any form of UI just yet, but have been generating images of the galaxies being created.
