Well, noone responded to my last blog, so I went ahead and decided to use the expat library. I've encapsulated the function of loading an xml file into a "WorldLoader" class. None of this is checked in, but in the next day or two I expect to be able to load a world from an xml file and maybe I can get some other people involved in making games for the fledgling engine.
