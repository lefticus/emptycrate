Say you have a list, array, vector, storage format doesn't matter: ` std::vector vec; vec.push_back(1); vec.push_back(17); vec.push_back(9);`

And you want to format this list into a comma delimited string *without the trailing comma*, what is the best way to do this? Example output:

> 1,17,9

In any language, with any list type. Post your answers here. Be sure to use code formatting for your answer, to make it easier for everyone to read. ` --my code solution`
