> PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that parts of Rhode Island's campaign finance laws regarding ballot questions are unconstitutional.

Not sure yet what I think about this one. I think campaign finance laws are a thin line to walk. On one hand, you want to make sure that our politicians are not owned by special interest groups. On the other hand, without campaign contributions only the super rich could afford to run. Quite possibly, the solution is to ban all contributions from non-individuals.
