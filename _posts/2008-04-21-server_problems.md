Due to a series of server mishaps that I will not bother going into right now, this website is now operating on a new server at a new host. As a consequence, the two websites: wiki.emptycrate.com and source.emptycrate.com are both offline. wiki.emptycrate.com was not really being utilized so it is offline permanently even though I could bring it back up with little effort. source.emptycrate.com had also been stagnant for more than a year but I do appreciate that there were projects on it that were being used by some people, including myself. Unfortunately the new server I am using does not have the capability of hosting the source control website, so I cannot bring it back online. I will, however, work on archiving and making available the subversion projects which were stored on the site. I will also work on bringing up some information about the Biblestudy project.
