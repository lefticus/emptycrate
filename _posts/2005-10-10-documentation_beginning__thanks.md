"Thanks for visiting the site," to everyone who came because of the [anouncement](http://freshmeat.net/projects/emtpycrate/?branch_id=60911&release_id=208842) on [freshmeat](http://www.freshmeat.net). I've started adding [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) style documentation to the framework in cvs. I've also checked in a doxygen configuration file in the docs folder for creating html based documentation. Once I complete the initial documentation I will post the html version of the docs to this site.
