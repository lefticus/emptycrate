I've now had the N800 for two weeks and would like to share some lessons learned.

-   First of all, upgrading to the latest version of OS2008 is critical to avoid the [power on bug](https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2673). ([Instructions](http://europe.nokia.com/A4305010)).
-   It is useful to add additional software repositories. A good list is contained at [gronmayer.com](http://www.gronmayer.com/it/)
-   The [maemo garage](https://garage.maemo.org/) is where much of the active software development happens and a lot of good news updates are available there.
-   The main [maemo site](http://maemo.org/downloads/OS2008/) has a fairly comprehensive list of available software as well as ratings and reviews. The top rated applications are listed [here](http://maemo.org/downloads/bestrated/OS2008/25/).
-   [Internet Tablet Talk](http://www.internettablettalk.com) is a forum and an invaluable resource of Nokia internet tablet information.

**Games**

1.  [Battle Gweled](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/battlegweled): a bejeweled clone
2.  [EightyOne](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/eightyone): implementation of sudoku
3.  [PenguPop](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/pengupop): bust a move clone
4.  [ScummVM](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/scummvm/): implementation of several adventure game engines, for playing older graphical adventures
5.  [DosBox](http://pupnik.de/dosbox.html): PC emulator with built in Dos implementation

**Media**

1.  [Canola2](http://openbossa.indt.org.br/canola/): blinged out media player; currently in rapid development
2.  [MPlayer](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/mplayer): versatile media player, used by Canola2 and others
3.  [fmradio](http://tableteer.nokia.com/tableteer/os2008/feat_fmradio.xhtml): allows access to the built in FM tuner
4.  [video camera](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/camera/): take videos with the built in webcam
5.  [handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/): not an internet tablet application, but a handy one for converting video for playback; settings that worked for me: 400x240 for anamorphic videos, 448x192 for 2.35 widescreen (with automatic clipping enabled) mp4 video, aac audio and "size to X megabytes" (250-400 in my case).

**E-Books**

1.  [Rapier](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/rapier/): simple yet functional [SWORD](http://www.crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) front end for reading of bible texts
2.  [FBReader](http://www.fbreader.org/): nice and flexible e-book reader; the text looks amazing on the high resolution screens of the Nokia internet tablets

**Note Taking**

1.  [Xournal](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/xournal/): graphical notepad with cool features like a "highlighter" and export to PDF

**System Tools**

1.  [DiskUsage](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/diskusage): graphically shows current disk usage for all mounted partitions
2.  becomeroot: allows you to become root from the xterm shell; install [this repository](http://www.gronmayer.com/it/dl.php?id=136) to get the package.
3.  [openssh](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/openssh): ssh client and server, 'nuff said
4.  [load applet](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2008/load-applet): process list with CPU load, memory usage and the ability to kill processes

**Other**

1.  [maemo-mapper](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/maemo-mapper/): nicely built road mapping software with the ability to download maps and gps tracking
2.  [omweather](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/omweather/): desktop applet with weather display
