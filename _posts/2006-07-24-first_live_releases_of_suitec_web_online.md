The first sites running [Suite-C Web](http://source.emptycrate.com/projects/suitecweb/) Drupal modules are up. The first is this one. The other is [fornewhope.org](http://www.fornewhope.org). The biblestudy module is running here. Almost everyone has some kind of opinion or question on the Bible, so go ahead, check it out, leave a note or a question and hopefully get an answer!
