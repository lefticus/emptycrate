I'm getting ready to start a 7 hour challenge from my cousin to write a Elite style game called Ex Astris today. Actually, my version is inspired by [Space Trader](http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/spacetrader/STFrames.html). Last night I got the latest version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) installed as I did not currently have a development environment set up at home that would allow me to do graphical Linux development. I hit my first hurdle in that the [Maemo](http://www.maemo.org) sdk is giving me a "too many errors occured during installation." So I will be ignoring that problem and moving on to straight Linux development in C++ using [gtkmm](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/), which should make porting to Maemo fairly easy. The game project is hosted at [Google Code](http://exastris.googlecode.com).
