I've consolidated my lessons learned from embedding scripting into the [Crate Game Engine](http://sourceforge.net/projects/emptycrate/) into a "book", [So You Want to Embed a Scripting Language in Your Application?](/content/so-you-want-embed-scripting-language-your-application) I will keep updating this document from time to time. Please post comments to let me know where I can fill in more details or give examples. Also, don't forget to keep voting in the poll to let me know which scripting languages are most important to have integrated with the game engine.
