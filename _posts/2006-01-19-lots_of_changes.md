1.  I have compiled a .net wrapper for the Sword library using SWIG and the Visual Studio Express Editions. I have attached the .dll's to this posting until something better is worked out.
2.  I have decided to start organizing a suite of Christian / Church applications for windows written for .NET and with Sword interaction built in.
3.  I have decided to stop work on the current C++ based Biblestudy and move to the new architecture mentioned in \#2
4.  I have created a new wiki style portion of this website to colaborate on the design of the new suite and why I have chosen to go the direction I am.
