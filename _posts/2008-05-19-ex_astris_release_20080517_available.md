Ex Astris 2008-05-15 snapshot is now [available](http://code.google.com/p/exastris/downloads/list). The economy was corrected from the previous release. A simple supply/demand model is used for determining the value of goods and the price is then negotiated based on the player's "Negotiation" skill. Also, there are Ubuntu and MacOS binaries available for download with this release.
