I often mention books that I use as resources, but rarely websites. It seems, on average, that online C++ resources are lacking. However, there are a few that I have found that provide quite valuable insight.

1.  [cplusplus.com language reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/). I am particularly fond of the iostreams reference.
2.  [SGI's STL reference](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/). It's an oldie, but a goody.
3.  [Stroustrup's C++ Style and Technique FAQ](http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html). It's a fascinating look into the language through the mind of the creator.
4.  [C++ FAQ Lite](http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/). Extensive collection of C++ questions and answers. Some of the answers are lite on detail, but you cannot ignore the wealth of information available.
