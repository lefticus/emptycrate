EmptyCrate Game Engine Release_2 was just posted to the Google code [project page](http://code.google.com/p/emptycrategameengine/). This release includes enhancements to the inventory box and the ability for items to interact with each other inside of the inventory. Also, this release includes a fixed size for the flash applet so that it works properly with smaller screens, such as the Maemo platform. The [game.emptycrate.com](http://game.emptycrate.com) site now includes several playable adventure games which work on all know platforms that Flash supports, including MacOSX, Windows and Maemo.
