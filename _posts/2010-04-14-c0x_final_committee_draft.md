As [others](http://herbsutter.com/2010/03/26/c0x-fcd-launches-will-be-freely-available-online-in-about-a-week/) have pointed out, the Final Committee Draft (FCD) of the next C++ standard is now [available](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3092.pdf) for anyone to download. The interesting thing is that the FCD is available for a free download, but once the standard is finalized, you will have to pay for the document. Downloading this one now might be a good idea for anyone hoping to keep up with the changes. The document is only 1300 pages, after all. Of course, [many](http://herbsutter.com/category/c/) [others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x) have covered this topic much more than I have. If you haven't been paying attention to the upcoming changes until now, this is probably the time.
