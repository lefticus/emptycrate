**Intro** I recently came across [this article](http://akaimbatman.intelligentblogger.com/wordpress/archives/42) about using the [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C64) (the most popular model of computer ever produced) in education and [the follow up article](http://akaimbatman.intelligentblogger.com/wordpress/archives/41) that suggests the possibility of a Commodore notebook. When I read those articles I was reminded of two things. I remembered having a dream around 5th grade of having a sub notebook C64. Probably the closest thing that existed at the time was the [Apple Powerbook 100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_100), which I don't ever recall seeing. The second thing that I remembered was that the first time I saw an Eee 2G my very first thought was "this needs to be running a [C64 emulator](http://www.viceteam.org/)." Now that [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9050206&type=product&id=1218012526050) has released a 9" Eee with a 1.6Ghz CPU at $280, the dream of the ultra portable C64 is easily attainable. **Economics** The Commodore 64 plus a matching [C1541](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541) disk drive was approximately $900, according to Wikipedia, in 1982. According to the [inflation calculator](http://www.westegg.com/inflation/), $900 in 1982 is $1900 today, making a 9" netbook about 1/7 of the cost of the C64 and disk drive. For 1/7 the price you get a computer that is at least 1600x faster, 16,384x the RAM and 49,344x the storage (without removing or swapping disks/flash). Also, the Eee can easily emulate the C64, C128, Vic20, NES, SNES, Atari and old DOS systems (plus many, many more). **Software** The main difficulty for your new system will be finding software that you can legally run on your emulators. Fortunately, E-bay is full of commodore software and some Commodore developers have chosen to release their software in these later years as [freeware](http://cbmfiles.com/geos/index.html). **Disclaimer** I haven't actually tried out this configuration, but I have just about convinced myself to purchase it while writing this article.
