A recent discussion with my cousin, Jon, about a self learning AI brain that could be used for automatically generating code degraded into this:

    [lefticus] let's just say the brain algorithm was a genetic algorithm
    [lefticus] with a random sampling of a few hundred
    [lefticus] that then chose mates and bred
    [lefticus] *that* would be how you would build the proper set of dopamine
                          responses
    [lefticus] after a few hundred machine hours you would have the brain you needed
                          to program anything you wanted
    [lefticus] however, it wouldn't be interested in helping you, only in working out
                          at the gym so it could find saucy female ai's to meet with

    [blacksheep1337] best line /ever/
