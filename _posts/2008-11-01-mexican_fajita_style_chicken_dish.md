And now for something completely different... A friend requested this recipe after staying with us for a night, so I thought I would put it up here. Disclaimer: I never cook to a recipe, so this is slightly different each time I make it. See the list of options at the bottom to see different variations I have made. **Ingredients**

-   2-3 Chicken Breasts Cut into approx 2"x1/4"x1" pieces
-   2 Jalapeno Peppers (Chopped Small)
-   1 Anaheim Pepper (Chopped Small)
-   1 Medium White Onion (Chopped Large Pieces)
-   3-4 Cloves Garlic (Chopped)
-   1 Teaspoon Salt (to taste)
-   1 Teaspoon Butter
-   2-3 Tablespoons Oil

**Hardware**

-   1 Heavy Large Pan

**Instructions**

1.  Heat Oil and Butter over medium heat in pan
2.  Add Vegetables, and salt
3.  Cook until onions are starting to become clear
4.  Add Chicken, stir
5.  We want the chicken to "stew" a little bit in the juices from the veggies. If there is not enough liquid in the pan just from cooking down the vegetables, add a little bit of water
6.  Cook until chicken is done

Serve with Tortillas or Chips and optional toppings such as sour cream, cheese and salsa. **Optional**

Replace chicken with some other type of meat, or tofu, or leave it out all together. If you leave the meat out you'll probably want some lettuce, black beans, rice or other type of topping/filler, as the onion, garlic and peppers by themselves can be pretty strong.

Add fresh [tomatillo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatillo) if in season and available.

Remove seeds from peppers to make it less spicy or add more peppers to make it more spicy.

Try other seasonings such as chili powder, crushed red pepper, paprika or cumin to play with the flavors.

Add reconstituted [anaheim peppers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_pepper) (chopped) into the veggie mix for an earthier flavor.

Dry roast the veggies before cooking them in the butter and oil. If you have a heavy cast iron skillet you are using for the cooking, you can do it in that.

Use a food processor to chop your veggies. Do NOT put the onion in the food processor, you want the onion pieces to be larger.
