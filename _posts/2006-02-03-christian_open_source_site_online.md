This week I opened up a new website designed specifically for Christian Open Source software. I'm currently hosting the rewrite of Biblestudy into C\# on it, as well as a new Suite of Church managment software. Check it out at: <http://source.emptycrate.com> Since I went through the trouble to put this site up for myself, I figured I would open up to the rest of the world. If you have any open source Christian software you've been hoping to write, check it out. Create and account and register a new project. Let your friends know! I want to get as much interest and traffic in this site as I can!
