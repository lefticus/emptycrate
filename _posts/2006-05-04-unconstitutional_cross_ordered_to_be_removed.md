CorruptionChronicles.com is [reporting](http://www.corruptionchronicles.com/2006/05/unconstitutional_cross_to_be_r.html) on a 17 year long battle in California to have a cross removed from a war memorial on state land. Somehow, every court that has heard the case has ruled that the cross violates Article 1, Section 4 of the California Constitution. I will quote it here:

> CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE 1 DECLARATION OF RIGHTS SEC. 4. Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed. This liberty of conscience does not excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace or safety of the State. The Legislature shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. A person is not incompetent to be a witness or juror because of his or her opinions on religious beliefs.

I defy ANYONE to explain to me how freely exercising religion is a violation of an article that guarantees the right to free exercise of religion.
