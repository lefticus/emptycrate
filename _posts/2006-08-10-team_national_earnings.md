I ran some simulations of the Team National (TM) commissions model. Every simulation I ran ends with \>96% making $1500 or less (with most making $0) Attached is the output from one simulation. I'm not 100% positive I got it right, but I do know that 96% of the people involved make $1500 or less. Warning the attached image is LARGE. Here is the summary: Total Money paid To TN: $369035 Total To Members: $43500 Total People: 200 Average Per Person: $217 Break down of earnings: $0: 186members (93%) $1500: 7members (3%) $2000: 2members (1%) $3000: 2members (1%) $5000: 1members (0%) $7500: 1members (0%) $10500: 1members (0%) If someone is willing to post here EXACTLY how the commissions model works, I will correct my simulation and run it some more.
