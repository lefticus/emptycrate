This blog and I have an ancillary interest in [game development](http://game.emptycrate.com). In my personal reading about adventure game design I came across the "[No Twinkie Database](http://www.designersnotebook.com/Design_Resources/No_Twinkie_Database/no_twinkie_database.htm)," as in: "Bad Game Designer, No Twinkie." There are some great tidbits in there worth considering.
