By request I have made available the latest snapshots of the SwigSword project (SWORD library with enhanced SWIG bindings) and the projects that made use of it: SwordSharp and SharpCSword. All 3 of these files are now hosted on [googlecode](http://swigsword.googlecode.com/). They were initially hosted on source.emptycrate.com before I had to take that site down.

-   [SwigSword](http://swigsword.googlecode.com/files/sword-20060206.zip): The library source itself with required SWIG binary for building the libraries (both C\# and C++ libraries are needed for working with Visual C\#).
-   [SharpCSword](http://swigsword.googlecode.com/files/SharpCSword-20071007.zip): complete example for how to use the sword library with C\#, including binaries of the request libraries and example modules installed
-   SwordSharp: Another GUI front end that made use of the SwigSword library. Both [source](http://swigsword.googlecode.com/files/SwordSharp%20Release_0.1.1%20Source.zip) and [binary](http://swigsword.googlecode.com/files/SwordSharp%20Release_0.1.1%20Windows%20Binaries.zip) releases are available
