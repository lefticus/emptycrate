Another 1.75 hours down. The days has in fact been very fragmented, but as I see it I still have 1.25 hours left in the initial challenge. The basic game play element of traveling has been implemented, but I don't have any UI as of yet. My plan is to take and modify the "radar" example from the gtkmm code and make it display my galaxy map. This should get me a start to graphical game play elements.
