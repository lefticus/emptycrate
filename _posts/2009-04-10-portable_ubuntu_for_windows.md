The [Portable Ubuntu for Windows](http://portableubuntu.sourceforge.net/) team has made available an Ubuntu distribution that runs fully inside of Windows using the [coLinux](http://www.colinux.org) kernel. The concept is fascinating, but it does fall down in a few places. First of all, on my Acer Aspire One, it takes a very long time to get started, which is probably fair because it is starting up an entire OS inside of the current one. Also, it seems to use a significant amount of RAM. This causes a lot of swapping on this 1G machine. Finally, the [recent news](http://www.osnews.com/story/21255/Portable_Ubuntu_for_Windows) about the project is related to some documentation updates, not to a new release. The currently available release is from mid last year and is of Ubuntu 804. The project seems interesting and may prove to be the answer I am looking for regarding some easy Linux development on this notebook, but it's not quite there yet, and relatively out of date.
