The game engine code is now functionally complete. 

Since the Milestone 3 release I have added support for in game Characters, talking to Characters, Objects and using of Objects. 

I have also added a dtd for validating game .xml files. 

You can see the dtd file on the sourceforge [webcvs page](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/emptycrate/crategameengine/docs/CrateGameEngine.dtd?view=markup). 

I have also updated the [ConsoleRenderingEngine](/CGEDoxygen/classCGE_1_1ConsoleRenderingEngine.html) to support these new features. 

The CVS version also addresses most of the issues outlined in the [Milestone 3 Critiques](/content/milestone-3-critiques). 

Don't get me wrong, there are many things yet to do before another release is made. I plan to have the next release out by the end of Thanksgiving Day weekend. Once that release is made, I will be moving on to scripting and a graphical rendering engine.
