OS News [announced yesterday](http://www.osnews.com/story/21151/Google_Releases_Chrome_2_0_Beta_Opens_Beta_Channel) that [Google Chrome 2.0 Beta](http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/chrome/beta/index.html) was just released. I've been searching for the perfect browser for my new [Acer Aspire One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYV9TM?ie=UTF8&tag=empcra-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001EYV9TM)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=empcra-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001EYV9TM) for a couple of weeks now and ended up settling on the stable version of Chrome. It works well because:

1.  It has a very minimal UI and does not take up too much screen real estate.
2.  It does not have the memory usage issues of firefox.
3.  It's very efficient javascript processor saves battery life and reduces heat.

However, it was missing the one thing that both IE and Firefox have and do well: full screen mode. Well, I'm happy to report that the new 2.0 Beta has full-screen mode and that the new engine feels even snappier then the old version on this netbook.
