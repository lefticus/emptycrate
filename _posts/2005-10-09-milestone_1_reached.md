The first milestone of the Crate Game Engine project was reached today after much work this weekend. You can see the list of milestones [here](/content/crate-game-engine-documentation). The first milestone means that the basic framework is now compilable and I will begin working an a C++ proof of concept to show that the framework is usable. The files are available on the sourceforge project at [http://sf.net/projects/emptycrate](http://sourceforge.net/projects/emptycrate/). For the benefit of the new readers brought here because of the release anouncement, I am attempting to blog the creation of this game engine, please hang out and read.
