I've now finished the preliminary design of the Crate Game Engine and have started implementing it. There's now a project page link over on the left as well. Oh, and a sourceforge page for the project too. 

I hope to have code that I have been implementing into sourceforge CVS tonight, then, if anyone is paying attention you can start following the progress and goals more closely.
