Just 3 months ago I [lamented the decline](/content/dr-dobb-where-art-thou) of [Dr. Dobb's Journal](http://www.ddj.com/). 

This past Monday I received an email indicating that Dr. Dobb's Journal print edition has ceased after some 33 years. All current subscribers will be [automatically switched](http://www.ddj.com/subscribe/) to the digital edition of Dr Dobb's Digest. 

The [March 2009 edition](http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785200/Dr-Dobbs-Digest-Mar-2009) of Dr. Dobb's Digest has been made available for free. I'm a big fan of e-books and digital magazines, and this new digest looks like it may have some potential. It contains several articles on multi-core and parallel programming that may be of interest to some of the readers of this blog.
