The [latest release](http://emptycrategameengine.googlecode.com) of the EmptyCrate Game Engine was made last night. Changes include:

1.  New Iconed pointers which use spacebar to toggle
2.  Black background and tweaked modal dialogs settings
3.  Moved inventory to left side to make it fit on an average screen better
4.  Add mouse-over for item names
5.  Disabled object glow effect

As always, check out [game.emptycrate.com](http://game.emptycrate.com) for examples.
