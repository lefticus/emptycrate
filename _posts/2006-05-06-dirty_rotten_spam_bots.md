I had enabled bad behavior on the wiki site, which is supposed block spam postings, but it is NOT working as well as it should. I've had to disable anonymous posting on the wiki site for now until I come up with something better. Perhaps it will be better when the 2.0 version of the bad behavior scripts are released.
