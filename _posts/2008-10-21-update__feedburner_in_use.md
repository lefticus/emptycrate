I've decided to start putting Google feedproxy + feed burner to use. Because I'm now adding ads to my RSS feeds, I'm also putting the full article text in the feed, so that you no longer have to click on "read more" to read the rest of the article outside of your reader. I hope this works out well, please leave a comment if anything is broken.
