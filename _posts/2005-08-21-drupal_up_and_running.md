Well, my first attempt at setting up a [Drupal](http://drupal.org) site is going well. I have worked with other CMS systems like [Xoops](http://www.xoops.org), but drupal seems to be much faster and more versatile. Something to keep in mind when programming in a compiled language: if you don't compile the app you won't see a difference. :)
