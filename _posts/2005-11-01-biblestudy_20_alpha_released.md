BibleStudy 2.0 alpha has been released to the sourceforge project [page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/christiangame). Some notes:

-   Reading Plans do not show up until after the first one is created with the ReadingPlanner wizard and the application is restarted
-   Use the biblestudy.bat file in the zip archive to launch biblestudy and avoid any pop-up warnings
