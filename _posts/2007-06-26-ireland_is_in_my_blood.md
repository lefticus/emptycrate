It's been now more than a year since we got back from our trip to Ireland, and sometimes I just think about going back there. I don't know really how to describe it, but I feel like the country is a part of me now. I've been to most of western Europe but Ireland, and particularly the Donegal region, has affected me than any other country I have been to. You can read about our trip [here](/node/4428), if you want to.
