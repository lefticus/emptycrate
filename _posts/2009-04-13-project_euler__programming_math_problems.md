[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) presents a rather extensive list of [problems](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems) which require a combination of programming skills and math skills to solve. The problems are interesting. I hope to from time to time post solutions to them on this website. However, I'm going to use an atypical programming language. I plan that each one I solve will be solved with C++ templates. By solving with templates the solution to the problem will be calculated at compile time and made available at runtime. The [first problem](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=1) presented is to total all of the integers less than 1000 which are divisible by either 3 or 5. I'll be posting my template based solution to it tomorrow.
