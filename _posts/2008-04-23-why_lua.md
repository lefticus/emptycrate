I friend of mine recently asked me what I thought of [Lua](http://www.lua.org/). It is, after all, the first language that I chose to [integrate](/content/crate-game-engine-snapshot-20080330-release) with the rewrite of the Crate Game Engine. The language itself, the syntax and structure, I am somewhat indifferent about. However, I am interested in it for other reasons:

-   Very lenient [license restrictions](http://www.lua.org/license.html): The site specifies:

    > Lua is free software: it can be used for any purpose, including commercial purposes, at absolutely no cost. No paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like "copyleft" restrictions, either.

-   [Fast](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all): faster than most interpreted languages such as Perl and Python and squarely slower than any compiled language. A pretty good middle of the road.
-   Tiny interpreter which is easily embedded in another application. From the website (no longer exists):

    > Under Linux, the Lua interpreter built with all standard Lua libraries takes 144K and the Lua library takes 196K.

-   Integrates well with C++. [Using](/content/swig-overview) [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) can make the process of exposing your C++ classes and objects to the Lua interpreter almost trivial.
-   It is one of the few languages [designed for embedding](/content/languages-designed-embedding).
