I went to [BoostCon](http://www.boostcon.com/) two weeks ago and as such have a ton on my mind and a lot to blog about. Most notable are the Boost [Spirit](http://spirit.sourceforge.net/) and Metaprogramming libraries. I also have been learning better how to put templates to use in the real world. I'll start with an entry about templates, then move forward with reviewing my boost notes and blogging about them as I can.
