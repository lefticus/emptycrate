I've just installed the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) [Twitter]() [module](http://drupal.org/project/twitter) which is supposed to add features such as automatic tweeting of blog postings. We'll see how well it works or not. I'll be tweeting under the name [lefticus](http://twitter.com/lefticus).
