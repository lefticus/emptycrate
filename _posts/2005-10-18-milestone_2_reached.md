[Milestone 2](/content/crate-game-engine-documentation) has been released, available on [sourceforge](http://sf.net/projects/emptycrate). This means that a proof of concept hardcoded c++ game is working. Expect a Milestone 2.5 as I add support for conversations and put some objects in the game world. Currently it is just a two player maze game. Everyone wants screenshots!
