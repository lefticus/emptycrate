Well, it only took about 250 miles of driving for me to get used to driving on the wrong side of the road. It's pretty much the same as driving on the right side, but backward. That's probably the same for Brits who move to the US too. One of the biggest things for me was getting used to steering with my right arm while shifting with the left. My right arm wanted to tire faster, since it wasn't used to it. The other hard part is the crazy way the roads are set up out here. They are very poorly marked, and narrow, and lanes seem to come and go for no reason at all. Dublin was the worst about that last bit. Getting pictures up is a little bit of a pain, but let's see if we can get a good driving shot up here. Well, I got something. We'll try and get better stuff up later. The server was down for a while. I rebooted it today and it seems to be working fine again.
