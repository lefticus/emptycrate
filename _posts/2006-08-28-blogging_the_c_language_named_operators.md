This is the first in a series where I am going to read through the O'Reilly C++ In A Nutshell language reference and blog about each part. This is mainly for me, to make sure I fully understand the language, and for you, if you care. This first one will be like a few others where I will group a set of pieces into one entry. For instance, this is all of the operators instead of today blogging about 'and' and tomorrow blogging about 'or'. Although, I will call out the cast operators, throw and new/delete into a separate posting
