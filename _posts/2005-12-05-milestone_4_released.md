Today sees the release of Milestone 4 of the Crate Game Engine. This release includes fully integrated support for the [Lua Scripting Language](http://lua.org). Lua was the "low hanging fruit" if you will. It was the easiest to integrate scripting language. The source release is up on [sourceforge](http://sf.net/projects/emptycrate).
