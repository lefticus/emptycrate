Now begins the whensdinner.com Winter of Code. By March 15th I plan to have written a commercially viable game. By myself. While working full time at my current job. Why? Mainly to make some extra $$, also, to prove it's possible. Today's games tend to be big budget, overdone, overpriced and late. The primary goal is to make a game that brings people together. The game will be one that is designed to engage two or more people sitting at the same computer, it will incorporate aspects of adventure games and rpg's. Stay tuned to this site for updates. By watching this site you will get to see the design and development process, my frustrations and my successes. I will likey make the game engine open source. If I do, you can expect very frequent updates or access to some CVS version. More info on that to come.
