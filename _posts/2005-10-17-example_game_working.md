I now have the ConsoleRenderingEngine working and a sample game to go with it. I'm not going to make an official release announcment until I have a better world for the game, probably something with items in it :) All of the source and documentation are available through CVS and the project page on this site. 

Some to-do's before I carry on with the project: Error Logging system and updating the source files to contain my copyright and the LGPL. 

Also, I just remember that a coworker who left my company last week used to do CVS keyword substitution in his code. That gives you the ability to have your error logger output the CVS revision of the file that generated the error, giving a near perfect way of tracking when and where errors occur. Some [info](http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/cvs-1.12.13/cvs_12.html). Expect to see that in the source tree soon.
