[Release 5](http://emptycrategameengine.googlecode.com) of the EmptyCrate Game Engine was just posted. This release addresses a single bug: the drupal Creative Commons Lite 6.x-1.2 module has a function name change that breaks the EmptyCrate Game Engine. As always, check out [game.emptycrate.com](http://game.emptycrate.com) for examples.
